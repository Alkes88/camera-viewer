This simple HTML video app allows you to use your iOS camera as a video source that covers the entire screen, without being obstructed by any camera controls.  This is the perfect solution for recording from your MacBook with QuickTime, while using your iPhone as the camera source.

#### Usage
Go to this address on your iPhone: https://Alkes88.github.io/camera-viewer/

Pinch zoom in/out on iPhone until video fits to screen.  Double tap on the video to switch between cameras (i.e. front/back).

**Only tested with iPhone X (iOS 13.2.1) and MacOS 10.14.6+ (Mojave)**

My Update: 
Forked project was supposed to include a double tap to switch between the cameras. This did not work. Tried multiple times to make this work with an iPhone15 until the code was changed so that it now only uses the rear camera on the iPhone and cannot switch. For what I need, this is good enough.
